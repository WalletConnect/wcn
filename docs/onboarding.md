## IRN Testnet onboarding 

### Get `irn_node` binary

Depending on your infrastructure either pull the docker image
```
docker pull ghcr.io/walletconnectfoundation/irn-node:1.451.2
```
or build the binary from source
```
cargo build -p irn_node --release
```
After a successful build the binary will be located in `target/release` folder.

### Generate cryptographic keypair

```
cargo run -p irn key generate
```
It will show you the following (**DO NOT use these example values for your node**)
```
Key 0
Private key: pKESPDecF6OB27qj5/JBKNeyBBdLyv8rkw+cgtjlc6E=
Public key: eMTmrtqEJKIUDvVgRx6igMJrxMJfTx6VE6KFdhsqZKo=
Peer ID: 12D3KooWHwoETeshEo4sNSLHv1Hoppq7au87kkDyzhQtgvSjacCR
```

You will need `Private key` in the following configuration section. Store it a secure place, and make sure you won't lose it.   
You may be asked to provide your `Peer ID` by other members of the network, it's similar to `Public key` and is a public information which may be freely shared.

### Configure the node

Configuration is being done via environment variables.
Here's the list of the required ones:

```bash
# Your private key, previously generated by `irn key generate`
export SECRET_KEY=$your_private_key

# Your public IPv4 address, each time your IP changes this variable needs to be updated.
export SERVER_ADDR=$your_public_ipv4_address

# The name of your organization, ex. "MyOrg".
export ORGANIZATION=$your_organization_name

# Identifier of the geographic region in which your node is going to be deployed.
# Available values: eu, us, ap.
export REGION=$region

# Directory in which the database data is going to be stored.
# It MUST be persistent.
export ROCKSDB_DIR=$rocksdb_dir

# Directory in which the consensus data is going to be stored.
# It MUST be persistent.
export RAFT_DIR=$raft_dir
```
