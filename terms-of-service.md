(iv) is or was lawfully received by the receiving party from a third party under no obligation of confidentiality.

### b. Protection of Confidential Information

Except as otherwise expressly permitted under the Network Terms and Conditions, with the express prior written consent of the disclosing party, or as required by law, the receiving party may not disclose, transmit, or otherwise disseminate to a third party any Confidential Information of the disclosing party. The receiving party will use the same care and discretion with respect to the Confidential Information received from the disclosing party as it uses with its own similar information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. The receiving party may disclose the disclosing party's Confidential Information to its employees, affiliates, consultants, subcontractors, agents, or advisors ("Representatives") who have a strict need to access the Confidential Information for the purpose of performing under the Network Terms and Conditions and only to those who are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information upon terms at least as protective as those contained in the Network Terms and Conditions. Either party may disclose the terms of this Agreement to potential parties to a bona fide fundraising, acquisition, or similar transaction solely in furtherance of evaluating or consummating the proposed transaction, provided that any such potential party is subject to written non-disclosure obligations and limitations on use no less protective than those set forth herein.

### c. Equitable Relief

The receiving party acknowledges that the remedy at law for breach of this Confidentiality Section may be inadequate and that, in addition to any other remedy the disclosing party may have, it shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including, without limitation, an injunction or injunctions (without the requirement of posting a bond, other security or any similar requirement or proving any actual damages), to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Confidentiality Section by the receiving party or any of its Representatives and to enforce the terms and provisions of this Confidentiality Section in addition to any other remedy to which the disclosing party is entitled at law or in equity.

### d. Compelled Disclosure

The receiving party may access and disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing party if legally required to do so in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding or order; provided, however, that in such event the receiving party will, if lawfully permitted to do so, notify the disclosing party within a reasonable time prior to such access or disclosure so as to allow the disclosing party an opportunity to seek appropriate protective measures. If the receiving party is compelled by law to access or disclose the disclosing party's Confidential Information as part of a proceeding to which the disclosing party is a party, the disclosing party will reimburse the receiving party for the reasonable costs of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information. Receiving party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed, and any Confidential Information so disclosed shall maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure.

## 15. INDEMNIFICATION

### a. Indemnity

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Node Operator will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Foundation and its respective past, present, and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns from and against all claims, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) that arise from or relate to (i) any third party claim that involves Node Operator's breach of any provision of the Network Terms and Conditions; or (ii) any claim related to Node Operator's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

### b. Potential Infringement

If the Node Software becomes, or in Foundation's reasonable judgment is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then Foundation may in its sole discretion: (i) obtain the right, for Node Operator to continue using the Node Software; (ii) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement; or (iii) modify the Node Software so that it is no longer infringing. If Foundation, in its sole and reasonable judgment, determines that none of the above options are commercially reasonable, then Foundation may, without liability, suspend or terminate Node Operator's use of the Node Software. This Indemnification Section states Foundation's sole liability and Node Operator's exclusive remedy for infringement claims.

## 16. RISKS; DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

### a. RISKS

NODE OPERATOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE NETWORK AND NODE SOFTWARE INCORPORATE EXPERIMENTAL AND NOVEL TECHNOLOGY AND THAT THE USE OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE NUMEROUS REASONS THE NETWORK AND/OR NODE SOFTWARE COULD FAIL IN AN UNEXPECTED WAY, RESULTING IN REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, POTENTIAL LIABILITY, LOSS OF DIGITAL ASSETS, LEGAL AND REGULATORY ISSUES AND OTHER UNEXPECTED AND UNFORESEEN RISKS.

### b. DISCLAIMER

THE NETWORK, ANY RELATED SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION SOFTWARE CODE, THE SERVICES, ANY INVOLVED DIGITAL ASSETS, AND THE REQUEST DATA ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". FOUNDATION DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FOUNDATION MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE NETWORK, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, OR REQUEST DATA WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS FREE, OR FREE OF MALICIOUS CODE OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. FOUNDATION DOES NOT CONTROL, ENDORSE, SPONSOR, OR ADOPT ANY REQUEST DATA AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND REGARDING THE REQUEST DATA. FOUNDATION HAS NO OBLIGATION TO SCREEN, MONITOR, OR EDIT REQUEST DATA AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY REQUEST DATA. NODE OPERATOR ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FOUNDATION HAS NO OBLIGATION TO CONFIRM THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY STATUS OF THE NETWORK AND SERVICES IN RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS, AND NO INDEMNITY, SUPPORT, SERVICE LEVEL, OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NETWORK TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

### c. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

FOUNDATION IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR DATA USE, OR DAMAGE TO BUSINESS) HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER BY BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE CAUSE OF ACTION EVEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE OR IF SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE.

## 17. TERM & TERMINATION

a. The Network is intended to be decentralized and self-operating, with or without any Services provided by the Foundation. Accordingly, we may, at our sole discretion, from time to time and with or without prior notice to you, modify, suspend or disable, temporarily or permanently, the Services offered by the Foundation, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever.

b. The Foundation is not liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification to any Services or from any suspension or termination, for any reason, of your access to all or any portion of the Website or the Services.

## 18. GOVERNING LAW; INFORMATION DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES NODE OPERATOR TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH FOUNDATION AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH NODE OPERATOR CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM FOUNDATION.

### a. Choice of Law and Jurisdiction

This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the Cayman Islands without regard to conflicts of laws analysis.

### b. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration

Any dispute, controversy, or claim between the Parties arising out of or relating to the Network Terms and Conditions, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, must be finally settled by arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be the Cayman Islands. The arbitrator(s) have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including, without limitation, specific performance, injunctive relief, and damages. The award rendered by the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement. Each party bears its own costs and expenses of arbitration, and the parties share equally the arbitrator's fees and administrative fees of arbitration. By entering into this Agreement, the Parties expressly waive their right to a trial by jury and agree that the arbitration shall be the exclusive forum for resolving all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

## 19. RISK CONSIDERATIONS

You acknowledge the following serious risks to any use of the Website and Services or your providing of Node Services, and expressly agree to not hold the Foundation liable if any of the following risks occur:

### a. Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions

The Services, the Network, the Node Services or Rewards could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Foundation to continue to develop the Website or Services, or which could impede or limit your ability to use the Website or Services or the Rewards.

### b. Risk of Alternative, Unofficial WalletConnect Networks

It is possible that alternative WalletConnect-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open source code and open source protocol underlying the WalletConnect Network and/or Services. The WalletConnect Network may compete with these alternative WalletConnect-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the WalletConnect Network, the Services and/or the Rewards.

### c. Risk of Insufficient Interest in the WalletConnect Network or Distributed Applications

It is possible that the WalletConnect Network will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the WalletConnect Network and potential uses of the Rewards. The Foundation cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.

### d. Risk that the Website and Services, as Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of User

You recognize that the Website, Services and the WalletConnect Network are under development and may undergo significant changes over time. You acknowledge that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the WalletConnect Network held by you may not be met for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans, specifications and execution of the implementation of the Website, Services or the WalletConnect Network.

### e. Risk of Security Weaknesses in the WalletConnect Network Core Infrastructure Software

The Website, Services and the WalletConnect Network operate with open-source software, and there is a risk that other third parties not directly affiliated with Foundation, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Website, Services or the WalletConnect Network causing the system to lose Rewards stored in one or more of your accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Website, Services and the WalletConnect Network, the Website, Services and the WalletConnect Network may experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Website, Services, the WalletConnect Network and Rewards.

### f. Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography

Cryptography advances over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Website, Services and the WalletConnect Network which could result in the theft or loss of Rewards. To the extent within its control and otherwise possible, the Foundation intends to update the protocol underlying the Services and the WalletConnect Network to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.

### g. Risk of Blockchain Network Attacks

Any blockchain used for the Services and/or the WalletConnect Network may be susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to: double-spend attacks, reorganizations, majority mining power attacks, "vampire" attacks, "selfish-mining" attacks, and work race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Services, the WalletConnect Network, expected proper execution and sequencing of transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Known or novel mining attacks may be successful.

### h. Risks Associated with New and Evolving Laws

The WalletConnect Network, and by extension the Website and Services, may be subject to a variety of international laws and regulations, including those with respect to financial or securities regulations, consumer privacy, data protection, consumer protection, content regulation, network neutrality, cyber security, data protection, intellectual property (including copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws), defamation, and others. Such laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the WalletConnect Network could be enacted. As the Website, Services and WalletConnect Network evolve, we may be subject to new laws, and the application of existing laws to us might change. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of the Foundation's attention and resources or restrict the way the WalletConnect may operate. If we do not sufficiently comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could receive negative publicity and be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely impact the Website, Services, and the WalletConnect Network and Rewards. Additionally, Node Operators of the WalletConnect Network may be subject to industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, the WalletConnect Network and/or Rewards could be adversely impacted.

### i. Market Risks

Rewards are intended to be used solely in connection with the WalletConnect Network, and we do not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of the Rewards. Even if secondary trading of the Rewards is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to market-related risks. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to the Rewards (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.

### j. Specific Risks Relating to Value and Function of Rewards

The utility benefits of using Rewards to access services provided by Node Operators can only materialize through user-driven adoption over time. Such adoption depends on a variety of factors, including the pace of user adoption, the organic community-driven expansion of the WalletConnect Network. As such, the extent of user adoption is entirely outside of our control and cannot be stated with any certainty. Any market value of Rewards may fluctuate in response to competitive and market conditions affecting the general supply of and demand for user-requested services. These conditions are beyond our control. The value of Rewards on the WalletConnect Network may be lower than the price or costs at which they were acquired or purchased. The utility of Rewards, and any value associated with that utility, will depend on the ability of the WalletConnect Network to adequately facilitate user-requested services. Inadequate supply may result in such services taking more time, while inadequate demand may make it difficult to obtain services, both of which may discourage participation in the WalletConnect Network. No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to Rewards, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that Rewards will hold any particular value.

### k. Unanticipated Risks

Cryptographic tokens such as Rewards are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in these Terms, there are other risks associated with the Services, the WalletConnect Network and Rewards, including those that the Foundation cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in these Terms.

## 20. GENERAL

### a. Severability; Waiver

If a term of the Terms, including the Network Terms and Conditions, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions continue in full force and effect. A party's consent to, or waiver of, enforcement of the Network Terms and Conditions on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or such provision on any other occasion.

### b. Independent Contractors

These Terms and Conditions do not create a joint venture, partnership, employment, agency or similar arrangement between the parties participating in the WalletConnect Network. No party has the right or power to act for or on behalf of any other or to bind any other in any respect. Foundation has the right to engage others to provide services similar to or competitive with the Services.

### c. Survival

For the avoidance of doubt, the following sections explicitly will survive the expiration or termination of a Node Operator providing Node Operator Services: Representations & Warranties; Node Rewards; Confidentiality; Indemnification, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability; Governing Law; Dispute Resolution, Arbitration; and General.

### d. Force Majeure

Neither party will be liable for any default or delay in the performance of its obligations under the Network Terms and Conditions, if and to the extent such default or delay is caused by fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God; wars, terrorist acts, site-specific terrorist threats, or revolutions; except to the extent that the non-performing party is at fault in failing to prevent or causing such default or delay, and provided that such default or delay cannot reasonably be circumvented and mitigated by the non-performing party through the use of alternate sources, workaround plans or other means.

### e. Publicity
